## Phase 1: Analyze requirements and create project structure
- [ ] Review the provided project description and attachments.
- [ ] Create the initial project directory structure.
- [ ] Create a README.md file with the project overview, use cases, architecture, tech stack, features, user personas, and project structure.

## Phase 2: Build backend infrastructure with FastAPI and MQTT
- [x] Set up a FastAPI project.
- [x] Implement basic MQTT client connection.
- [x] Define initial API endpoints.

## Phase 3: Implement ML models for predictive maintenance
- [x] Research suitable ML models for predictive maintenance.
- [x] Prepare a dummy dataset for training and testing.
- [x] Implement a basic ML model (e.g., a simple regression or classification model).

## Phase 4: Create database schema and data pipeline
- [x] Define PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB schema for asset data and telemetry.
- [x] Set up a local PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB instance (e.g., using Docker).

## Phase 6: Implement MQTT client and real-time data ingestion
- [x] Enhance the MQTT client to subscribe to telemetry topics.
- [x] Implement real-time data processing and forwarding to the frontend.

## Phase 7: Create Docker containers and deployment infrastructure
- [x] Create Dockerfiles for backend, frontend, and database services.
- [x] Set up Docker Compose for local development and testing.
- [x] (Optional) Explore Kubernetes and Terraform for future deployment.

## Phase 8: Add monitoring, logging, and production configurations
- [x] Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- [x] Implement structured logging for all services.
- [x] Configure environment variables for production deployment.

## Phase 9: Test the complete system and create documentation
